This file stores details about site structure

_data folder:
Refer this https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/06-data-files/    to see how to use _data folder
_data folder is used to store data files
Data files are a great way to separate content from source code to make the site easier to maintain
we can keep here yaml, json, csv
The data from the files is read by _includes/*.html/md file and maybe can also be read by other files, refer docs

_includes folder:
Refer this https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/05-includes/
_includes folder is a great way to seperate code that is used in multiple places
we can use the file in includes folder by adding  {% include file.html %}   in other files-->

_layouts folder:
Refer: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/04-layouts/  on how to make layout,
It has layouts in it, layouts help in making the template of page, and we can specify the layout at front matter i.e on top by writing
---
layout: layoutname
---
The default.html is configured as default layout for all the Pages in _config.yml, so we don't have to specify it at the top of page in front matters


_posts folder:
posts folder store blog post markdown/html and all the files in it are shown in the front page, this is used when you are using the site as blog

_site:
After running 'bundle exec jekyll serve' the create site data (generated static site) is placed in it.
You can also upload the _site files and serve pages online and these files are enough to serve the site.

_config.yml:
This file store all the configuration related to jekyll, plugins to use, default layouts etc, after changing this file
you will have to rerun bundle exec jekyll serve   to pick up the changes

Gemfile and Gemfile.lock:
These files stores the information related to the environment required (plugin versions, ruby version etc) to generate the static pages (or generate the site)
You should use 'bundle exec jekyll server' to uses these files automatically to setup the environment for jekyll to generate

CNAME:
This stores the domain name of the file through which the site is accessible

assets (currently doesn't exist in site structure):
This folder is used to store css, js, images etc
Refer this: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/07-assets/
